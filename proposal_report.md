# Plant disease classification

## Domain background
World population is forecasted to be 9.6 billion by 2050 this means there will be a lot more people to feed with fewer food supplies. Crop disease is a   major threat to food production, these infectious diseases reduce the potential yield of the crop by around 40%. Many smallholder farmers across the world are experiencing immense loss due to these crop diseases. Many farmers are lacking knowledge about these varieties of crop disease, early detection and the right knowledge about the disease will help farmers in preventing the spread across the field and increase the production yield of the crop.
